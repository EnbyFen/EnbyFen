### Hi there, my name's Fen ðŸ‘‹

I'm nonbinary, and use [they/them](https://pronouns.is/they) pronouns. I'm also a Computer Science major at the [University of San Francisco](https://usfca.edu). I'm interested in learning Python and Java primarily at the moment, but I want to later use my skills to go into into Music Technology. 

If you want you can check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fenwright/), or my [Bandcamp](MoonOfWands.bandcamp.com) if you want to see my musical work.
